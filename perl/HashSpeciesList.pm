## getSpeciesTable ##
# 
# This subroutine opens a local file called 'SpeciesList' by default. Alternatively
# you can pass in a custom file name. If no name is provided and the file is not
# found, the routine will attempt to download the file from the BridgeDb repository.
# The SpeciesFile will then be read and parsed into a hash which is returned by
# the routine. USAGE: call this method and assign it to a hash variable. Use the
# hash to keep track of all the different ways to refer to a species.
##
# RETURNS A HASH OF ARRAYS
#
# KEY: common name
# [0]: genus species
# [1]: taxonomy ID
# [2]: three-letter unigene code
# [3]: two-letter code
